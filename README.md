- **JavaScript (ES6+)**

### 2. JavaScript Requirements
- Use **pure JavaScript** (ES6+) without any libraries or frameworks.

2. Compile SCSS/Sass code into CSS.
3. Minify `.js` and `.css` files.
4. Optimize images.
5. Prepare the project for hosting (build process).

### 4. Interactive Web Elements
To practice working with the **DOM**, implement the following interactive components using JavaScript:
1. **Multi-level Burger Menu**: Create a responsive and interactive burger menu with multiple levels.
2. **Tab Menu with Animation**: Implement a tabbed interface with smooth animations when switching between tabs.
3. **Multilingual Website**: Develop a multilingual feature where users can toggle between different languages.

## Technologies Used
